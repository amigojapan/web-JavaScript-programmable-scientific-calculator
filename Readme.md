This is a JavaScript based highly extensible calculator which can be used
to make calculations and also create one's own customised functions for 
calculations.

Todo list:
1) Good looking graphics.
2) Proper orientation to buttons and a good caption textboxes.
3) A super good graphing feature.
4) fix the bugs if any!
